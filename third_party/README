How to update libeio
====================
Note: we have two important changes to the stock libeio:
- it's possible to change the libeio thread stack size
  with EIO_STACKSIZE constant. In particular, EIO_STACKSIZE
  set to 0 means the default stack size.
  A larger stack size is necessary to make getaddrinfo()
  work.
